Once you have accepted the invitation, feel free to [transfer the repository](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/after-your-application-is-accepted) into the backdrop-contrib group at any time (ask here if you have questions).

As an "Author" you will have permission to triage any issue in any queue for any project. If you would like to contribute directly to any of the GR projects, you should request co-maintainership for that project to get your name added to the `README.md` file before making any direct commits.

Thank you so much for your previous contributions, and we look forward seeing you in the contrib queues :)
